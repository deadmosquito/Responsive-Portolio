          <p> Welcome to my portfolio page! </p>
          
          <p>  My name is Steven Sorensen and I am a Web Developer with an interesting bakground which I believe 
          strengthens my coding ability. I have lived in 4 different countries and learned the languages of those 
          countries along the way but the one that lingers is the Mandarin Chinese language. I still practice the 
          language by surprising unsuspecting restaurant workers. The other languages I learned were Portuguese 
          and Russian if you were curious. </p>
          
          <p>  What does that have to do with coding? I look at coding in a similar way to learning those languages.
          Not only is a new language with puzzles to solve but it also illuminates the part of the world where 
          people are speaking it and encourages me to go deeper and learn more. </p>
          
          <p>  Web Development also allows me the chance to be creative with my work and lets me build a product with
          my hands and I really enjoy having a finished tangible product to celebrate. </p>
          
          <p>Please browse my portfolio and see what you like.</p>
